A crimson Jumpman decorates a tongue patch made with fuzzy chenille, while an embroidered ‘23’ lands on the vamp. A red and black brushstroke graphic adorns synthetic overlays along the lateral and medial sides.

Contrasting blue accents appear on the interior lining, molded eyelets, and the raised Jumpman logo that decorates the heel tab. A second Jumpman graces the tongue in copper-colored embroidery, matching the circular eyelets that dot the forefoot. The mid-top is mounted on a two-tone polyurethane midsole, equipped with a visible Air-sole heel unit and supported by a durable grey rubber outsole.",

Tumbled black leather is utilized on the upper, contrasted by green mesh inserts and molded eyestays in a vibrant blue finish. ‘SHAQ’ is emblazoned across the heel in block lettering, while ‘Tennis’ and ‘Reebok’ are embroidered on the tongue. The latter is equipped with a rubber button that activates the sneaker’s retro Pump technology. Green speckling enlivens the black foam midsole, supported underfoot by a herringbone-traction rubber outsole."

      "story": "The Nike Women’s Dunk Low Premium ‘Vintage Red’ pairs classic two-tone color blocking with an aged aesthetic. The heritage hoops shoe makes use of a smooth leather upper, featuring a stark white base with contrasting overlays in a dark crimson finish. The latter hue is repeated on the signature Swoosh and woven Nike tongue tag. Rendered in Coconut Milk, the midsole is built with stitched sidewall construction and reinforced by a burgundy rubber outsole."
